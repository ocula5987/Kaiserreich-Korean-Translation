siamn.1.t:0 "1936년의 시암 왕국"
siamn.1.d:0 "One of the countries that benefited from German victory during the Weltkrieg, Siam regained most of its former land which had previously been lost to the western imperialists. While Siam's relationship with the Huns is, in general, cordial, the fact that they thwarted her expansionist ambitions during the 1929 Intervention in Burma has strained diplomatic and military ties between the two. If Siam should reconcile with the Germans or align itself with others powers is a matter to be decided in the coming decade."

siamn.2.d:0 "Ever since the coronation of King Rama VII in 1925 most, if not all, of the policies set forth by Siam have been dictated by the Aphiratthamontri Sapha (Council of State). This is a council made up of the King's older siblings, who have continually worked to consolidate their power while keeping the power of the king over the nation weak. Despite promising the [SIA.GetAdjective] intelligentsia that a codified constitution would be issued any reform has been tough to pass, as it would be against the interests of the nobility.\n\nSurrounded by enemies, such as the the Konbaung dynasty to the west, Yunnanese bandits to the north, and the German imperialists to the east, Siam is in a dire situation. It will either perish, forever confined to the pages of a history book, or shall reform itself and emerge a modern state, be it by negotiation or through the use of force."

siamn.3.t:0 "왕국의 여러가지의 많은 문제들"
siamn.3.d:0 "While seemingly economically and industrially prosperous to outside eyes, Siam is actually very reliant on investments made by Germany and must cherish the economic ties it shares with the nation. Industry is a very fragile and small section of the economy, which is mainly built around rice, sugar, and timber exports. Nationalism among ethnic minorities has been rising, which raises the spectre of separatist movements in the near future. On top of all this: the bloated bureaucratic system, which has been present since the reign of Rama VI, has siphoned off much needed taxes and thus allowed for bandits to continually run wild in the fringes of Siam."

### Agricultural Path ###
SIA_agriculuralmechanisation:0 "농업 기계화"
SIA_agriculuralmechanisation_desc:0 "Rice paddy uses over half of the arable land in [SIA.GetName], yet it consists mainly of peasants farming small areas and producing modest amounts of rice. By providing cheap, low-interest loans for the purchase of tractors and modern equipment we can free some of these farmers from the ricefields and send them to the factories instead, without compromising crop yields."
SIA_agrarianscoop:0 "농업 협업체"
SIA_agrarianscoop_desc:0 "While the first [SIA.GetAdjective] co-op was created back in 1916, co-ops themselves aren't a common sight among rural communities yet. By persuading rice farmers to pool their savings together and organize into co-ops they will have enough money to buy the badly needed farming equipment in these hard times, and obtain greater bargaining power against the rice merchants."
SIA_communalapproach:0 "공동체에 다가가다."
SIA_communalapproach_desc:0 "Rice is central to [SIA.GetAdjective] society. As a nation we have long relatively self-sufficient, resistant to government intervention and egalitarian. Most rice farmers owned their own land and exchanged labour with other farmers to cover their needs. By focussing on and enhancing these aspects of [SIA.GetAdjective] society and encouraging further cooperation within the community we can build a better country, while safeguarding it from aristocrats and landlords."

SIA_exportrice:0 "수출지향적 쌀 생산"
SIA_exportrice_desc:0 "Rice is central to [SIA.GetAdjective] society. Rice production normally does not ammount to much more than the farmer needs to survive, leaving very little to profit from. If necessary we can colaborate with large rice merchants and mills to supply a market pressure for more production, or we can simply obligate the farmers to produce more by increasing their rice tax."
SIA_ricesubsidyscheme:0 "쌀 농업 보조금 제도"
SIA_ricesubsidyscheme_desc:0 "By creating incentives for those farmers who have accomplished huge increases in their rice output and allowing peasants to own the land they've cleared for agricultural purposes we can provide simple market incentives to cultivate more land and increase crop yields."

SIA_femalecorps_desc:0 "While 'Ja-Khlone', female palace guards, have been a common sight in the inner palace since the Ayutthayan era having female soldiers in active combat is on another level altogether. Luang Phibunsongkhram himself has voiced limited support for the petition, but the question is still up in the air. Persuing such measures is sure to anger traditionalists."

SIA_royalmunitionsfactory:0 "Royal Munitions Factory"
SIA_royalmunitionsfactory_desc:0 "Having enemies on all sides, Siam nearly used up all her artillery shells during the Weltkrieg, with no means of being freshly supplied. This has resulted in a massive supply of artilery shells being hoarded by the paranoid logistics department over the years, but additional ammunition factories would definitely help us in the event of prolonged conflict."
SIA_industrialmobilization:0 "Industrial Mobilisation Plan"
SIA_industrialmobilization_desc:0 "In the times of war, key industries will temporary be put under governemnt control to ensure our nation's survival. While this has proved to be unpopular, it will keep our army adequately armed and increase our chance of winning this war."
SIA_phaopoliceintegration:0 "Integration of the Police Command"
SIA_phaopoliceintegration_desc:0 "Police General Phao Sriyanond suggests that we should elevate the police force to the same level as the other 3 branches of the Royal Siamese Armed Forces.

### Navy Path ###
SIA_royalsiamesenavy:0 "시암 왕립 해군"
SIA_royalsiamesenavy_desc:0 "Established in 1887, the RSN has similar organisational structures to the United States Navy, since it is composed of both the naval fleet and the Royal Siamese Marine Corps. It was also the second Asian nation to acquire submarines, after Japan."

SIA_expandmarinescorps_desc:0 "Although 'Taharn Ma-Rine' were first founded back in 1833, the unit served mostly as a royal honor guard throughout the 19th century. It wasn't until 1913 that the Siamese Marines were reorganized into the modern "Navy Amphibious Assault Group" who saw some action back in the Weltkrieg.

SIA_improvedlandingcraft:0 "Improved Landing Craft"
SIA_improvedlandingcraft_desc:0 "The Siamese Marines currently use ex-British merchant ships we seized back in the Weltkreig as their only mean of transportation. Having dedicated amphibious landing ships will make sure that our boys can embark and secure the beachhead faster."
SIA_newflagship:0 "A New Flagship"

SIA_coastaldefenseships:0 "Coastal Defence Ships"
SIA_coastaldefenseships_desc:0 "While these heavily armed cruisers are no match against the Deutsch-Ostasienflotte or Imperial Japanese Navy, and have limited capability in the high seas, they will surely serve our cash-strapped navy well, especially in the island-dotted coastal waters of both the Gulf of Siam and the Andaman Sea."
SIA_riverpatolunit:0 "River Patrol Units"

SIA_subships_desc:0 "These 'Ruea-Sor's were first envisioned by late Prince Mahidol Adulyadej, who studied at the Marineschule Mürwik, as 'essential' to the defense of Bangkok and by extension the Gulf of Siam. While we have procurred four small submarines for the first line of defense; continuing the second phase of the plan, which entails another 5 submarines for the outer defensive line, might be a good idea."
SIA_twooceannavy:0 "A Two-Ocean Navy"
SIA_twooceannavy_desc:0 "Our navy is perhaps too small to face the Kaiserliche Marine or the IJN head-on. Some additional funding would definitely help."
SIA_expandsattahip:0 "Expand Sattahip"
SIA_expandsattahip_desc:0 "Sattahip was first built as the RSN's main naval base back in 1914. As the base is quite small and already reaching its support capacity limit, expansion of its facilities is definitely in order."
